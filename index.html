<h1>Sandy Speaks</h1>
<p>I was curious about this artwork because of the question asked above, also the title image, which
led me to being curious about the meaning behind this piece. The title refers to Sandra Bland and
her series of social media videos named “Sandy Speaks”, a victim of police brutality to which
this artwork raises awareness. Through the use of artificial intelligence and markup language,
people can essentially chat with a virtual memory of Sandra. It is a space in the virtual realm to
ask questions on police brutality and reflect as it prints answers similar to what Sandra would
have said based on speech from her videos. Watching the video of a person interacting with the
chatbot, it was interesting to me how the chat platform made it clear to separate Sandy (AI) from
Sandra (the person), which really paints the picture of recognizing there is someone in every
story.</p>

<h1>HTC1.0</h1>
<p>The artwork I chose to write about is titled “ HTC1.0” by Mark Amerika. It is described as “an exploration into cyborg narrators, virtual reality, and the teleportation of narrative consciousness into the electrosphere”. My understanding is hazy, (this is extremely abstract and complicated work)  and there may be some room for interpretation as to how to decipher this work, but I will give my perspective; It seems just as much a stream of consciousness from Mark America as it is an exploration of these abstract terms in the description. That is to say that this work functions as artistic self expression from the creator, and a philosophical meditation on the internet and it’s relationship with human consciousness, knowledge gathering, and reality. Mark Amerika suggests that the internet has and will change the way we perceive ourselves and knowledge itself, as it is leading us away from notions of self and suggesting everything is connected. This work suggests the virtual reality of the internet and our own consciousness are connected, with several fictional scenarios where navigating the internet seems to be likened to navigating our real world which I find to be a cool way of understanding the internet. I generally think that this work is interesting, albeit extremely hard to understand, and it feels like Mark Amerika intentionally speaks in abstractions for some sort of artistic effect. The work seems to be an exhibition of it’s own main ideas, as it displays the way in which knowledge gathering has become a highly sporadic and nonlinear experience in the digital age, with these hundreds of links leading to different texts that explore different aspects of hypertextual consciousness. I view this work as a product of a deeply philosophical artist who is interested in the ways the internet affects knowledge and consciousness, and does a good job as an artist of making the work an experience that plays with the interactor's consciousness. . My brain hurts trying to describe this work and its ideas. I think the fictional aspects that portray navigating the internet as real world visceral experiences is cool. I feel like the work was correct in predicting that the internet would become deeply engrained into our minds, warping our reality and experience of life, and it did it in a very cool artistic way which I appreciate. It is a little too difficult to digest in one sitting and I likely need to return to expand my understanding of Amerika’s  ideas.</p>
