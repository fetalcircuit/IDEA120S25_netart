<h1>Sandy Speaks</h1>
<p>I was curious about this artwork because of the question asked above, also the title image, which
led me to being curious about the meaning behind this piece. The title refers to Sandra Bland and
her series of social media videos named “Sandy Speaks”, a victim of police brutality to which
this artwork raises awareness. Through the use of artificial intelligence and markup language,
people can essentially chat with a virtual memory of Sandra. It is a space in the virtual realm to
ask questions on police brutality and reflect as it prints answers similar to what Sandra would
have said based on speech from her videos. Watching the video of a person interacting with the
chatbot, it was interesting to me how the chat platform made it clear to separate Sandy (AI) from
Sandra (the person), which really paints the picture of recognizing there is someone in every
story.</p>
