<h1>Sandy Speaks</h1>
<p>I was curious about this artwork because of the question asked above, also the title image, which
led me to being curious about the meaning behind this piece. The title refers to Sandra Bland and
her series of social media videos named “Sandy Speaks”, a victim of police brutality to which
this artwork raises awareness. Through the use of artificial intelligence and markup language,
people can essentially chat with a virtual memory of Sandra. It is a space in the virtual realm to
ask questions on police brutality and reflect as it prints answers similar to what Sandra would
have said based on speech from her videos. Watching the video of a person interacting with the
chatbot, it was interesting to me how the chat platform made it clear to separate Sandy (AI) from
Sandra (the person), which really paints the picture of recognizing there is someone in every
story.</p>

<h1>HTC1.0</h1>
<p>The artwork I chose to write about is titled “ HTC1.0” by Mark Amerika. It is described as “an exploration into cyborg narrators, virtual reality, and the teleportation of narrative consciousness into the electrosphere”. My understanding is hazy, (this is extremely abstract and complicated work)  and there may be some room for interpretation as to how to decipher this work, but I will give my perspective; It seems just as much a stream of consciousness from Mark America as it is an exploration of these abstract terms in the description. That is to say that this work functions as artistic self expression from the creator, and a philosophical meditation on the internet and it’s relationship with human consciousness, knowledge gathering, and reality. Mark Amerika suggests that the internet has and will change the way we perceive ourselves and knowledge itself, as it is leading us away from notions of self and suggesting everything is connected. This work suggests the virtual reality of the internet and our own consciousness are connected, with several fictional scenarios where navigating the internet seems to be likened to navigating our real world which I find to be a cool way of understanding the internet. I generally think that this work is interesting, albeit extremely hard to understand, and it feels like Mark Amerika intentionally speaks in abstractions for some sort of artistic effect. The work seems to be an exhibition of it’s own main ideas, as it displays the way in which knowledge gathering has become a highly sporadic and nonlinear experience in the digital age, with these hundreds of links leading to different texts that explore different aspects of hypertextual consciousness. I view this work as a product of a deeply philosophical artist who is interested in the ways the internet affects knowledge and consciousness, and does a good job as an artist of making the work an experience that plays with the interactor's consciousness. . My brain hurts trying to describe this work and its ideas. I think the fictional aspects that portray navigating the internet as real world visceral experiences is cool. I feel like the work was correct in predicting that the internet would become deeply engrained into our minds, warping our reality and experience of life, and it did it in a very cool artistic way which I appreciate. It is a little too difficult to digest in one sitting and I likely need to return to expand my understanding of Amerika’s  ideas.</p>

 <h1>Nobody Here</h1>
 <p>This work “Nobody Here” intrigued me. What initially drew me in was the cover photo since it is a man sitting, staring closely at his computer, but there are shadows behind him that look frustrated. To me, that's how the internet and social media make me feel sometimes, so I wanted to further explore this work. This art is meant for you to get lost in. You click and scroll on the endless pages where you can find different art and poems and stories. This is such a cool piece of art that really confuses and impresses me. I wish I knew more about how he made this and how long it took. Some of the poetry really resonated with me and my favorite one that I related to most I put down below.

 <h1>Skinonskinonskin</h1>
 <p>Skinonskinonskin by Entropy8Zuper!, described by them as a DHTMLove Affair, is an
interactive website created from a series of virtual love letters sent back and forth between the
two authors / artists / creators. Aureia Harvey and Michael Samyn sent these websites back and
forth between each other privately before later compiling them into one to create this series.
Today it lives on in an emulator created on Rhizome. After you click “start emulator,” you see
Microsoft Windows 98 begin on your screen, accompanied by the start up noise. You are then
led to a desktop that is fairly plain, and soon Skinonskinonskin starts up on Netscape. The first
page of the website / series is a set of lungs offset by a black background and beating heart
sound. As you move your mouse around the screen, you hear someone inhale and exhale. You
can click to the next page, but the beating heart does not stop - this sound is a vital part of the
Skinonskinonskin interaction experience. Along the top of the webpage is a black menu bar with
hyperlinked words like “close,” “hands,” “horoscope,” “air,” and “net love,” each with a unique
artwork displayed on the corresponding page. The black menu bar extends to show more
options if you allow your mouse to edge scroll. For example, a page titled “freezing” displays an
image of one of the creators, Aureia Harvey, with her face partially obscured by her hair, looking
almost pressed up against a window or some other constraint, longing for the person on the
other side of the screen. A small, lowercase “Z” is fixed on one of her fingertips, and as you
hover your mouse over this spot, her voice whispers through the computer: “Come to me, I’m so
cold.” I have shown this page below.</p>

 <h1>Nobody Here</h1>
 <p>Nobody here is an art project by an untitled artist where the entire piece is just words that are linked to their own separate thoughts. And each thought has a few other thoughts that can be spun off to link inside of that original thought. It keeps going and loops for a very long time. It didn’t take much to go through just a couple since the list of possible words is just so insanely long I couldn't look through it all. However, just from what I have seen is already so incredible because the artist somehow got most of any thoughts that could occur in a day to be in one website that is a series of questions and statements, or even as simple as only images. That is some impressive programming and thinking that shows something that I run into a lot is spiraling thoughts that are always connected.

 <h1>entropy8.com</h1>
 <p>Entropy8 was a landmark in the history of net art, made my Auriea Harvey in 1995.
Entropy8 with even with it limitations was able to create an experience like no other that I have
seen. Entropy8 uses graphs that remind me of old horror games that you would find on oline at 3
in the morning. Entropy8 in my opain has a look and fincthin of a puzzle game, that you have to
click and explera the sulleing of the game to find hints to the puzzle. Personally, it’s not my type
of game but I do enjoy the graphs and art stype of the game.</p>
